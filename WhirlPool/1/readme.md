## Description
<!-- HTML can be used here if needed -->
WhirlPool inc. makes software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network... but it broke and some evil data got into our network. We were able to capture a bunch of traffic, but we need someone to filter out the evil data for inspection.
